# User Stories

Marie is new to Washington D.C. She used to volunteer in her home town all the time, but has struggled to find opportunities	that really interest her here in D.C. The only resource she’s found is Facebook, and it’s hard to not only find a relevant page but then navigate through that page and find volunteer opportunities. Auxilium will help her clearly see what opportunities there are for her in the D.C area. It’ll also allow her to easily sign up and make an account, and then register to help out at that event.

The Children’s Museum of D.C is looking to find volunteers to help out with an upcoming play they’re putting on. They could make a post on Facebook and find volunteers that way. However they wouldn’t be able to verify how many volunteers they have, if they need more, or already have how many they need. Also they would not have easy access to any of the contact info of the individuals looking to volunteer for them. On top of that, if some of the volunteers are not that great, there’s no way that they can leave feedback for other companies in the future.
